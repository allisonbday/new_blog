Post 4: Applying the Rules

Title idea: "Calculating Formula 1 Standings with Custom Rules"

Purpose: Glue Part 2 (rules) and Part 3 (data).

Content:

Take raw race results.

Apply your PointsRules logic.

Show how different rulesets produce different championship outcomes.

Maybe demonstrate “what if 2008 was scored by 2024 rules?”

Deliverable: A reproducible standings calculator.
