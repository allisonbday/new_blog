Title idea: "Pulling Formula 1 Data with the Ergast API"

Purpose: Bring in external data → show you can handle APIs.

Content:

How to connect to the Ergast API (or FastF1 if you want lap times).

Pull one season’s worth of race results.

Normalize/clean the data into a table you control.

Deliverable: A dataset you can feed into your rules engine.
