Post 2: Setting Up the Foundation

Title idea: "Structuring a Rules Engine in Python with Dataclasses"

Purpose: Start small, show off clean engineering design.

Content:

Introduce your PointsRules dataclass.

Why you chose dataclasses.

Make a few serialized JSON examples of scoring rules (1980s vs modern).

Maybe a notebook that loads them and prints example points allocations.

Deliverable: A working rules engine, even without race data yet.
