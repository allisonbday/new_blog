The `index.qmd` file is a listing page, which generates the page containing all of your posts.

# Universal

``` yaml
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  sort-ui: true
  filter-ui: true
  max-items: 100
  pagination: 50
  image-placeholder: placeholder.gif
  image-height: 250em
  categories: unnumbered
  fields: [title, description, date, reading-time, categories]
```

## `contents`

`contents` is the folder where your posts are located. It will display any `.qmd` file in the directory.

It is important to note that the contents folder is relative to the listing file, in this case, the `index.qmd` file. For more on paths, see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/globs.html).

You can also list multiple paths, separated into bullet points. You can also [specify directories to exclude](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#including-or-excluding-items) from your listing. For example, I have a folder called `posts/Projects` that I don't want to show up on my index page, so I have `!posts/Projects` in my `contents` field.

``` yaml
listing:
  contents: 
  - posts
  - "!posts/Projects`
```

## `sort`

`sort` is the order in which your posts will be listed. You can have multiple sort fields, separated into bullet points.

``` yaml
listing:
  sort: 
  - "date desc"
  - "title asc"
```

## `sort-ui`

`sort-ui` is a boolean that determines whether or not you want to have a sort drop down menu on your index page. You can also specify which fields you want to be able to sort by. [*üîódocs*](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#sorting)

``` yaml
listing:
  sort-ui: [title, date]
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
You can only sort by fields that are in your fields list.

# `type`

There are three types of listings: `default`, `table`, and `grid`. The default listing is the one you see on the index page. You can see all three here on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#listing-types). Each listing type has fields that you can customize [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#listing-fields).

I use both the grid listing, for my projects, and the default listing, for all articles, on my index page.
