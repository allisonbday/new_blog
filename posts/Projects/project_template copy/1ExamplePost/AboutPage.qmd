When I first made my Quarto blog, the first thing I wanted to do was claim it! So here's a detailed guide on how to make your `About` page ABOUT YOU!

Here's a link to the [Quarto About Page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) docs.

# 1️⃣ Claim it

Fill in the YAML at the top. Add your name, your picture, and anything you want to highlight. I have LinkedIn and GitHub, but you can add any [Bootstrap 5](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) icon!

``` yaml
title: <name here>
about:
    image: profile.jpg
    template: jolla
    links:
    - icon: linkedin
      text: LinkedIn
      href: <link to LinkedIn profile here
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: <link to GitHub account page here>
```

You should also describe yourself! Avoid big blocks of text - use bullet points, lists, and unique formatting to make it easy to read (and don't forget to use emojis!)

    -   👀 I'm interested in
    -   💗 I'm passionate about
    -   🔭 I'm currently working on ...

::: callout-tip
If you don't want to have bullet points, have two empty spaces at the end of each line to force a line break!

And don't forget to add your education and work experience!

# 2️⃣ Embeds

Quarto is the next evolution of R Markdown, meaning it's a markdown file! Anything that can be embedded in markdown (HTML, iframes, etc.) can be embedded in Quarto.

A non-exhaustive list:  

- Maps
- Videos
- Tweets
- Instagram Posts
- Spotify Playlists
- GitHub Gists

I decided on 2 Github stats apps, but you can add anything you want!

```markdown
![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=<username>&show_icons=true)
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=<username>&layout=compact)
```

![Allison\'s GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=allisonbday&show_icons=true)![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=allisonbday&layout=compact)

I also included the icons of my favorite languages and tools using [Skill Icons](https://skillicons.dev), and some HTML to center it

```HTML
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skillicons.dev"> 
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode"/> 
  </a>
</p>
```

  <a href="https://skillicons.dev"> 
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode"/> 
  </a>
</p>


# 3️⃣ Templates

Quarto has five templates you can use to make your About page look even better: `jolla`, `trestles`, `solana`, `marquee`, and `broadside`. You can see them all [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates).

I chose `jolla` because I liked how it was centered like my GitHub stats. To use a template, add the following to your YAML:

```yaml
about:
  template: solana
```

If you don't like your image being a circle or you don't like the size, you can change it to a rectangle by adding the following to your YAML:

```yaml
about:
  template: marquee
  image-width: 10em
  image-shape: rectangle
```
