    "text": "This project is inspired by Mr V’s Garage.\nAfter watching Mr V’s video I immediately had a few questions. How would 1950s rules affect the current standings? How would rule changes affect all of the drivers and constructors championships? And most importantly - is there any way for Charles LeClerc to be champion?\nTo answer these questions requires a system that can automatically fetch race results, clean test and store it, and a way for users explore custom rules. In data engineering terms - a pipeline, a database, and an interactive dashboard.\n\nArchitecture & Design\nBreak problem into components: ingestion, processing, storage, presentation.\nPick tools intentionally and justify them (“Dataclasses for structured configs”).\nDeliverable: Diagrams, schemas, maybe some pseudocode.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart \n    %% Nodes\n    A[\"⏰ Scheduler\"]:::process --&gt; B[\"🏎️ Pull F1 API Data\"]:::process\n    B --&gt; C[\"🧹 Cleaning Script\"]:::script\n    C --&gt; D[\"🧪 Data Testing Script\"]:::script\n    D --&gt; E[\"🗄️ Database (Structured Schema)\"]:::data\n    E --&gt; F[\"📊 Streamlit App\"]:::app\n    F --&gt; G[\"⚙️ User Applies Custom Scoring Rules\"]:::app\n\n    %% Classes\n    classDef script fill:#d0e7ff,stroke:#3399ff,stroke-width:1px\n    classDef data fill:#d0ffd6,stroke:#33cc33,stroke-width:1px\n    classDef app fill:#fff7c0,stroke:#ffcc33,stroke-width:1px\n    classDef process fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#999999,stroke-width:1px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Core Logic\nBuild the smallest piece of logic independent of data sources (rules engine, algorithm, etc.).\nDeliverable: A working Python module, tested in isolation.\n\n\nData Acquisition & Cleaning\nBring in external data → normalize → define your schema.\nDeliverable: Clean dataset & documented transformations.\n\n\nIntegration\nConnect ingestion + core logic. Test end-to-end flows with small datasets.\nDeliverable: Reproducible pipeline.\n\n\nInterface / Presentation\nBuild a way to interact with the system (dashboard, API, report).\nDeliverable: MVP app.\n\n\nIteration & Scalability\nAdd features, optimize performance, handle edge cases, refactor.\nDeliverable: Polished v2."
