So here’s a detailed guide on how to make your About page ABOUT YOU!\nHere’s a link to the Quarto About Page docs.\n\n1️⃣ Claim it\nFill in the YAML at the top. Add your name, your picture, and anything you want to highlight. I have LinkedIn and GitHub, but you can add any Bootstrap 5 icon!\ntitle: &lt;name here&gt;\nabout:\n    image: profile.jpg\n    template: jolla\n    links:\n    - icon: linkedin\n      text: LinkedIn\n      href: &lt;link to LinkedIn profile here\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: &lt;link to GitHub account page here&gt;\nYou should also describe yourself! Avoid big blocks of text - use bullet points, lists, and unique formatting to make it easy to read (and don’t forget to use emojis!)\n-   👀 I'm interested in\n-   💗 I'm passionate about\n-   🔭 I'm currently working on ...\n-   🌱 I'm currently learning ...\n-   💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on\n-   👯 I'm looking to collaborate on ...\n-   🤔 I'm looking for help with ...\n-   💬 Ask me about ...\n-   📫 How to reach me: ...\n-   ⚡ Fun fact: ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to have bullet points, have two empty spaces at the end of each line to force a line break!\n\n\nAnd don’t forget to add your education and work experience!\n\n\n2️⃣ Embeds\nQuarto is the next evolution of R Markdown, meaning it’s a markdown file! Anything that can be embedded in markdown (HTML, iframes, etc.) can be embedded in Quarto.\nA non-exhaustive list:\n\nMaps\nVideos\nTweets\nInstagram Posts\nSpotify Playlists\nGitHub Gists\n\nI decided on 2 Github stats apps, but you can add anything you want!\n![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=&lt;username&gt;&show_icons=true)\n![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=&lt;username&gt;&layout=compact)\n\nI also included the icons of my favorite languages and tools using Skill Icons, and some HTML to center it\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"https://skillicons.dev\"&gt; \n    &lt;img src=\"https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,r,md,github,vscode\"/&gt; \n  &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  \n\n\n\n3️⃣ Templates\nQuarto has five templates you can use to make your About page look even better: jolla, trestles, solana, marquee, and broadside. You can see them all here.\nI chose jolla because I liked how it was centered like my GitHub stats. To use a template, add the following to your YAML:\nabout:\n  template: solana\nIf you don’t like your image being a circle or you don’t like the size, you can change it to a rectangle by adding the following to your YAML:\nabout:\n  template: marquee\n  image-width: 10em\n  image-shape: rectangle\n\ntitle: Make your About page about YOU sub"
